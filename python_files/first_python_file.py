print('Hello World')


# Any line that starts with '#' is a COMMENT.
# Comment lines are for humans to read, the computer won't read them
# Leave notes for yourself or the next person who might use this code.
# Well-commented code is a blessing.

# The next bit is real code. It's some instructions to the computer.
# "Print" means "write something in the terminal panel down there below"
# What would you like to print? Fill in some comment between the '' marks

print('')

# By the way, words that not instructions to the computer always need to be in ' '
#  or  " "  marks. 

# UNcomment the next line, hit Run, and see what happens
# print(Ida B. Wells)

# OK fix that line above and re-run.

# Let's mess around some more.
# Uncomment this next section:

# print('What is your name?')
# user_name = input()
# print('Ahoy there, ' + user_name)
# print('The length of your name is:')
# print(len(user_name))

# OK great, now UNcomment this next section too

# print('Please give me a number between 1 and 10:')
# some_number = input()
# half_number = (int(some_number)/2)
# print('Half of that is:')
# print(half_number)

# int() ?? What is that?
# A function!  A built-in piece of code that comes with Python.
# It's short for INTERGER.  You're telling the computer:
# "Hey, everything in these parentheses is a number."
# Before we go on, let's check out some other built-in functions at the
# official Python page:
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

# What other built-in functions have we already used?
